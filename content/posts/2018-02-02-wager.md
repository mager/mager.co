Crypto is everywhere now, but I always wondered if people were just going to trade it, or actually use it for something productive.

When I heard that the [creator of Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin#Ethereum) was just a guy working on Bitcoin that wanted to attach code to blockchain transactions, I had to learn more. I also heard the buzz word “decentralized app” (or dApp for short), but I never really could explain what one was.

_My attempt to explain how Ethereum is different than Bitcoin._

So, what type of code would be transferred alongside a money transaction? With Ethereum, you write something called a “smart contract”. I had trouble wrapping my head around this until I saw an actual example in code.

Let’s look at a very simple contract:

_An inbox contract. Imagine if it cost money to send an email…_

Even if you know nothing about [Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/), the language of smart contracts, you can see above that we are initializing a class called `Inbox` with a string called `message`. It looks like we can `setMessage`, and that’s about it.

When you call `setMessage`, you’re changing data in the contract, and any time you do that, you have to send a transaction to the Ethereum network.

So decentralized apps are just apps that interact directly with the blockchain.

### Sending Money with Contracts

Let’s look at another contract to see how money is moved around:

![](/media/2018-02-02-wager/1_8u1TrUM7iZzKKMhKJWtKxw.png)

_A lottery contract. Make that money move._

In this one, there is an `enter` function that has `payable` in the definition. This function expects there to be a value associated with the transaction (in this case 0.1 ETH). Next, there is an `address[]` array that we `push` the `msg.sender` (the player) into. Finally, the `pickWinner` function chooses a random entry in the `players` array, and pays them out the balance in the contract with `transfer()`.

The cool thing about Solidity contract is that you compile it to be understood by Javascript, and you can write tests with Mocha:

All of this, by the way, was taught to me by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/stephengrider), who has a class on Udemy called [_Ethereum & Solidity: The Complete Developer’s Guide_](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide).

Deploying a contract to the Ethereum network is pretty easy too:

Once a contract is deployed, you can use the `web3` library to interact with it from a React app.

I had an idea to build an app for the super bowl.

### The Big Game Contract

Here’s the idea for the app:

- 12 players
- Each player can choose a team (either “birds”, or “pats”)
- Each player must send 0.015 ETH (about $20) to enter
- If your team wins, you split the pot with everyone else who chose that team

Let’s dive into the contract function by function to understand how this could work.

![](/media/2018-02-02-wager/1_rhJkykZTQGFiT3d7nIOrug.png)

_Let’s get this party started!_

We initialize `BigGame` with a `manager` (the person who deploys the contract, me), two `address[]` arrays to represent each team, and a `playerIndex` mapping of `address => uint`. Thin of the `playerIndex` mapping as a hash of every single Ethereum address, initialized to zero.

When players enter, I’ll update their `playerIndex` so I can display their status on the web page.

```
+-------------+---------------------+
| playerIndex | status              |
+-------------+---------------------+
| 0           | Not entered         |
| 1           | Entered birds       |
| 2           | Entered pats        |
| 3           | Entered birds, won  |
| 4           | Entered pats, won   |
| 5           | Entered pats, lost  |
| 6           | Entered birds, lost |
| 9           | Refund everybody    |
+-------------+---------------------+
```

Yes, if something goes wrong, I have a function that will refund everybody.

One more thing to note: `restricted` is a function modifier that we’ll use later on the `pickWinner` function. This only lets the `manager` pick a winner.

Let’s check out of the meat and potatoes of the contract, the `enter` function:

Notice `payable` in the function definition. The key here is `transfer`, which takes the payout for the winning team (calculated with `this.balance / teamName.length`), and `transfer`s an even amount to each player.

Let’s check out the `pickWinner` function:

_Fingers crossed!_

This cycles through the list of players in the winning team and `transfer`s the payout equally (`this.balance / teamName.length`) and sets the `playerIndex`. Solidity doesn’t allow you to compare two strings natively, so I had to create a function to do that.

Finally, let’s take a look at the `refundEverybody` function:

![](/media/2018-02-02-wager/1_0CUVaaiQAtIrlelyanECyA.png)

_Just in case, ya know?_

Using `delete` essentially resets those address arrays if I wanted to try again.

That’s basically it. The next challenge was to build a React app that talked to the blockchain and interacted with the contract. Here’s what it looks like before entering:

![](/media/2018-02-02-wager/1_mVkl257rEAPq8VsuWufTXQ.png)

_`playerIndex` is 0 still_

And when you click the “enter” button:

_Rinkeby is a test network for Ethereum._

The app uses [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), which is a Chrome extension to let you interact with the Ethereum blockchain in your browser. Think of it as a wallet you can use on websites. Once the transaction is submitted, you have to wait a little while (20–30 seconds) for the miners to confirm the transaction. Once there are block confirmations, you’ll get back a transaction hash. [Here’s the one I got back when I took this screenshot.](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0xde5433b50ba9c2dfa5f2aa0dd01ea46c38944dc6f8e266c265784c324fb6c495)

When you refresh the page (I know), you should see that you’re entered:

![](/media/2018-02-02-wager/1_L3HnfMgIDvLFPRtPCiz1xQ.png)

_Fingers crossed!_

Remember the `manager` variable above? When I switch back to the original Metamask account that I deployed the contract with, I can see a special Manager Tools section:

![](/media/2018-02-02-wager/1_8R0sja8umxFaOx2-kzPnsA.png)

_It’s tempting to never use the middle button._

Let’s see what the page looks like when I pick a winner:

Now the payouts are zero’d out and I noticed some extra ETH in my account. It would have been cool to show the final payout, but I didn’t have time.

It’s crazy to think this website doesn’t have a database; it relies on the contract’s data changing when people enter or pick a winner.

### Conclusion

It was awesome learning about dApps and contracts, and I hope to keep building more.

By the way, the Big Game contract is [deployed to the main Ethereum network now](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf70Ee4bBD117eeb37983A73Eb383B4190E33ed26).

If you want to check out the full contract, check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/wagerlife/contracts).

If you’re interested in the tech stack, I used:

- React for components (create-react-app)
- [Bulma](http://bulma.io) for CSS framework
- Redux for data layer (reduxForm was considered)
- Mocha and granache for testing (also [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org))
- solc to compile the Solidity to Javascript
- web3 library with [Infura](http://infura.io) hosts for talking with the Ethereum network
- Docker for containerization
- Zeit’s [Now](https://zeit.co/now) for deployments
