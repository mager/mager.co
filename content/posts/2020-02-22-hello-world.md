mager.co is back!

The website has a few goals:

- Post interesting stuff over time - You'll see anything I'm passionate about at the time. I'll likely most a lot about music, cooking, and coding. I love taking photos so this site will be media-rich.
- Backfill old content and photos - I have a lot of photos and memories on line, but they aren't organized in a single place

Each post is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is a format that isn't going away any time soon:

And this website is built using the open source project [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and hosted using [Netlify](https://netlify.com):

Update: The current design is from the [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/), but expect something different soon when I collaborate with [@marcm](https://twitter.com/marcm).

For now I'll keep it simple, but expect more posts. I'll likely re-post everything on Twitter so [find me there](https://twitter.com/mager) if you want to follow along.
